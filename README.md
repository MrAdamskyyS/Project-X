# Project-X
Project: X is a low poly style racing game created in Unity to pass the "Programowanie w silnikach graficznych i VR". It allows players to compete in fast-paced timed laps around a track. Players can select tracks, cars, and customize car settings in the menu. Cars are equipped with nitro, which players can use once during a lap. After completing laps, the game displays lap times and offers the option to view telemetry data such as speed and braking force. All 3D models were created entirely by the developer using Blender. The game also features a "Ghost-car" script for replaying the player's best lap, although it currently has issues with time scaling.
